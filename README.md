# Stock Chart App
Website: https://stock-chart-app-klm.herokuapp.com/

This is a project I made for FCC.

In this project I learned:
* Socket.io
* Redux-socket.io
* Chart.js

I got to practice:
* How to make an Isomorphic App
* Redux with thunk and socket.io
* Axios
* React
* API calls
* Mongoose models
* Node js
* Express js

I'm giving credits to the following for some educational reference that helped me make this app:
