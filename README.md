# Stock Chart App
Website: https://stock-chart-app-klm.herokuapp.com/

In this app you can view a chart of stock market prices of choice(1 year period).
You can add and remove symbols according to your prefence.
Web socket is also used in this app so every change you/other people make gets submitted to every other users in realtime.

This is a project I made for FCC.

In this project I learned:
* Socket.io
* Redux-socket.io
* Chart.js

I got to practice:
* How to make an Isomorphic App
* Redux with thunk and socket.io
* Axios
* React
* API calls
* Mongoose models
* Node js
* Express js
* Babel and webpack usage

I'm giving credits to the following for some educational reference that helped me make this app:
