This is a project I made for FCC.

In this project I learned:
* How to make an Isomorphic App
* Redux and thunk
* Axios
* Mongo-connect to express-session
* Passport twitter

I got to practice:
* React
* API calls
* Passport
* Mongoose models
* Node js
* Express js

I'm giving credits to the following for some educational reference that helped me make this app:
